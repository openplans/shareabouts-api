From 0 to a Shareabouts API instance in about an hour
======================================
Shareabouts requires python2.6 or greater (and PostgreSQL 9.1 and development libraries by default to build).


What's here
------------

This package contains the Shareabouts API web service,
which is a Django web application providing:

* A RESTful web service
* A management user interface, at /manage
* The basic Django admin UI, for low-level superuser tasks, at /admin

The Shareabouts web application JavaScript and related files are
*not* part of this package. [You'll need to install that separately](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/).

For more about the parts of Shareabouts,
see [the architecture documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md).


Database
--------

The Shareabouts REST API requires GeoDjango.  To install GeoDjango on your
platform, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/#platform-specific-instructions.

Create a development database for the Shareabouts data store.
Typically for PostGIS 1.5 this is done like:

    createdb -T template_postgis shareabouts_v2
    
For PostGIS 2.0:
    
    createdb shareabouts_v2
    psql -U postgres -d shareabouts_v2 
    \password postgres
    Enter new password: <enter your password>
    Enter it again: <enter your password again>
    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;    
    \q

Copy the file
`src/project/local_settings.py.template` to `src/project/local_settings.py` and fill in the
credentials for connecting to your development database.  This file will not be
checked in to the repository.

NOTE: If you are getting a "Peer authentication failed" error, you may need to set `HOST` in the DATABASES section to `localhost`. This is because Django attempts to connect to the database using UNIX sockets by default. More information on this error can be found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8167602/django-connection-to-postgresql-peer-authentication-failed/8232004#8232004)

Then bootstrap the development database using the usual Django command:

    src/manage.py syncdb --migrate


Local setup
------------

Install `pip` and `virtualenv`, if not already installed.  These will keep your
requirements isolated from the rest of your machine.

    easy_install pip
    pip install virtualenv

You may need to use `sudo` to install these tools.

    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install virtualenv

Create a new virtual environment inside of the repository folder, and install
the project requirements:

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

NOTE: If you run in to trouble with gevent, you can safely comment it out of
the requirements.txt file.  It is not needed for local development.  To comment
it out, just add a hash to the beginning of the line for `gevent`.

To run the development server:

    src/manage.py runserver 8001

This will start the service at http://localhost:8001/ .

If you don't specify a port, the server will start on port 8000.
We recommend getting in the habit of using port 8001 so you can
work with the sa-web front end application on the same development
host, and run that one on port 8000.

NOTE: If you're new to programming with virtual environments, be sure to remember
to activate your virtual environment every time you start a new terminal session.

    source env/bin/activate



Running the Shareabouts Web Application
-----------------------------------------

For local development, you will probably also want to install and run [the
front-end mapping application](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/).


Deployment
-------------

See [the deployment docs](DEPLOY.md).


Testing
--------

To run the tests, run this command:

  src/manage.py test
